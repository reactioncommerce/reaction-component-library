## Component
Description of the issue this PR is solving, why it's happening, and how to reproduce it. This may differ from the original ticket as you now have more information at your disposal.

## Solution
Summarize your solution to the problem. Please include short descriptions of any solutions you tested before arriving at your final solution. This will help reviewers know why you decided to solve this problem in this particular way and will speed up the review process.

## Screenshots
Include mobile screenshots as well.

## Breaking changes
You should almost never include "BREAKING CHANGES" because we’re duplicating components to avoid that. Consult with others before doing it.

## Testing
1. List the steps needed for testing your change in this section.
2. Assume that testers already know how to start the app, and do the basic setup tasks.
3. Be detailed enough that someone can work through it without being too granular

More detail for what each of these sections should include are available in our [Contributing Docs](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/contributing-to-reaction)
