# Signing your Commits

Contributing to the Reaction Component Library requires signing your work by way of signed Git commits.

The Reaction Component Library uses the Apache 2.0 license to allow our community and customers to use it in whichever way they please. It also helps foster open contributions.

As a contributor, we want to make sure that you understand your rights as the copyright holder. We also want to make sure that contributions done on behalf of companies (i.e. by their employees) are submitted with the acknowledgement that the contributor (employee) isn't the copyright holder (employer).

The Reaction Components Library is using a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), by way of signed commits, to help contributors acknowledge that they're aware of their rights, and that they have the authority to submit their contributions either on their or on their employer's behalf.

The DCO signoff is attached to every single commit, thereby stating that the committer agrees to the DCO as shown below or on <https://developercertificate.org/>.

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to   
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
